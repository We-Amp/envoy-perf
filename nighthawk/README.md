# Nighthawk

*A L7 HTTP protocol family benchmarking tool based on Envoy*

## Current state

The nighthawk client supports HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 over HTTP and HTTPS.

HTTPS certificates are not yet validated

## Prerequisites

### Ubuntu

First, follow steps 1 and 2 over at [Quick start Bazel build for developers](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/bazel/README.md#quick-start-bazel-build-for-developers).

## Building and testing Nighthawk
```bash
# build it
bazel build -c opt //nighthawk:nighthawk_client

# test it
bazel test -c opt //nighthawk/test:nighthawk_test
```

## Using the Nighthawk client

```
➜ bazel-bin/nighthawk_client --help

USAGE:

   bazel-bin/nighthawk_client  [-v <trace|debug|info|warn|error>]
                               [--concurrency <string>] [--h2] [--timeout
                               <uint64_t>] [--duration <uint64_t>]
                               [--connections <uint64_t>] [--rps
                               <uint64_t>] [--] [--version] [-h] <uri
                               format>


Where:

   -v <trace|debug|info|warn|error>,  --verbosity <trace|debug|info|warn
      |error>
     Verbosity of the output. Possible values: [trace, debug, info, warn,
     error, critical]. The default level is 'info'.

   --concurrency <string>
     The number of concurrent event loops that should be used. Specify
     'auto' to let Nighthawk leverage all vCPUs that have affinity to the Nighthawk
     process. Note that increasing this results in an effective load multiplier
     combined with the configured --rps and --connections values. Default: 1.

   --h2
     Use HTTP/2

   --timeout <uint64_t>
     Timeout period in seconds used for both connection timeout and grace
     period waiting for lagging responses to come in after the test run is
     done. Default: 5.

   --duration <uint64_t>
     The number of seconds that the test should run. Default: 5.

   --connections <uint64_t>
     The number of connections per event loop that the test should maximally use. Default:
     1.

   --rps <uint64_t>
     The target requests-per-second rate. Default: 5.

   --,  --ignore_rest
     Ignores the rest of the labeled arguments following this flag.

   --version
     Displays version information and exits.

   -h,  --help
     Displays usage information and exits.

   <uri format>
     (required)  uri to benchmark. http:// and https:// are supported, but
     in case of https no certificates are validated.

## Sample benchmark run

```zsh
# start the benchmark target (Envoy in this case) on core 3.
$ taskset -c 3 /path/to/envoy --config-path nighthawk/tools/envoy.yaml

# run a benchmark on cores 0 and 1
$ nighthawk taskset -c 0-1 bazel-bin/nighthawk/nighthawk_client --duration 5 --rps 20000 --concurrency auto http://127.0.0.1:10000/
